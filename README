Stepper Motor Control

Linux:
------

if you use an USB-RS232 converter (usually such converters have /dev/ttyUSB0 as linux device
  name) use the devicename as the first argument to ctb::open instead of
  CTB::COM[1-9].

A nonpriviledged user (non root) needs to have permission to talk to the
UART. It needs to be in the same group as /dev/tty* (in fedora
this group is called dialout)
